## Key React Concepts Used

This project leverages core React concepts to enhance the functionality and user experience:

1. **Functional Components**: Modular, reusable components make up the UI.
2. **JSX**: Combines JavaScript and HTML for rendering dynamic content.
3. **State Management**: Uses `useState` for managing internal states like form inputs.
4. **React Router**: Seamlessly navigates pages (Home, Cart, Wishlist).
5. **useEffect**: Manages side effects (e.g., data fetching).
6. **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically renders components based on interactions.
7. **useLocation and useNavigate**: Handles page-specific styles and navigation.

## State Management with Context API

**Global State Management**: The Context API enables global state sharing, primarily for managing cart and wishlist data across components:

- **Centralized State**: Reduces the need for prop drilling, enhancing performance and making data access straightforward.
- **Real-Time Cart & Wishlist Updates**: Changes to the cart or wishlist reflect instantly across the application, providing a unified experience.

3. **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and sort items, with real-time price updates and a $1000 limit.
4. **Wishlist**: Save items to a wishlist and easily transfer them to the cart.
5. **Order Confirmation Modal**: Confirms purchases and redirects to the homepage.
6. **Price & Category Filtering**: Refines product search results.
7. **404 Error Page**: Custom error page for unrecognized routes.
